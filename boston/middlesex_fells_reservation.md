[Middlesex Fells Reservation](https://www.mass.gov/locations/middlesex-fells-reservation) is a large state park north of Boston, with a large trail network. It has decent transit connectivity, and you can actually bus all the way into the park, though when I visited I preferred an alternate entrance that let me experience more of the [Orange
Line](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/Orange/line?schedule_direction%5Bdirection_id%5D=1&schedule_direction%5Bvariant%5D=Orange-3-1). I'll use my standard methodology of choosing the option with the least frequency first, to make it less necessary to time leaving the park.

1. Take the Orange Line to Malden Center.
1. Transfer to [MBTA bus 100 to Elm Street](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/100/line) 
1. Ride to Fellsway W & Fulton. You'll get off at a big roundabout off I-93; not fun but you only have to walk away from it.
1. Walk to S Border Road and enter the park via the South Border Parking Lot. From here you can access the entire park network, though note that I-93 bisects the park and is a large barrier between the east and west lobes of the park. Main Street crosses I-93 twice in the park (once under and once over) and provides the best ways to cross the interstate I could find, though is itself quite busy and unpleasant.

Once you're done exploring the park:

1. Make your way to the Woodland Path heading east
1. This will join up with the Cross Fells Trail at the Observatory Rock Circuit where it crosses Fellsway.
1. Continue east on the Cross Fells Trail until you reach the trailhead at the end of Goodyear Ave.
1. Turn right (South) on Washington Street and walk for about 10 minutes until you reach the Oak Grove station, which is the end of the Orange Line and take it back to Boston.
