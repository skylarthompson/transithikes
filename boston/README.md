Boston obviously has very good mass transit (no pun intended) with the [MBTA](MBTA) providing frequent bus and train service to the city and close-in suburbs. MBTA uses the [CharlieCard](https://www.mbta.com/fares/charliecard) for fare payment, which you can buy from various ticket vending machines and retail locations.

I assume you can get to downtown Boston for these guides.
