Portland, OR has excellent public transit for a city of its size, and has a lot of areas that feel very remote despite being close to the city. You can either pay using a HOP card or contactless credit/debit cards. If you use the latter, make sure to use the same card to take advantage of fare capping!

I assume that you're able to get downtown or to a MAX station.
