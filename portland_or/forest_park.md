[Forest Park](https://www.portland.gov/parks/forest-park) is a huge park along the Willamette River. If you've taken the [Amtrak Cascades](https://amtrakcascades.com/) service north of Portland, look up to the south of the train tracks; the cliff that stretches on forever has the park at the top!

Unfortunately, transit service to the park is sparse, though there is the [Washington Park MAX station](https://trimet.org/max/stations.htm) - the only underground station in the MAX system - which is served by the [Red](https://trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm) and [Blue](https://trimet.org/schedules/maxblueline.htm) lines. Despite that, my recommendation would be to start farther out and work your way back, as bus service is infrequent and timing a MAX connection is much easier.

1. Catch the [TriMet route 16 to St. Helens](https://trimet.org/schedules/r016.htm) in downtown Portland.
1. You will cross the [St. Johns bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Johns_Bridge) to make a coverage loop, which is a spectacular example of modern Gothic architecture and a destination of its own. You can either get off in Cathedral Park and walk back across the bridge for some great views, or stay on the bus and get off at Bridge & Springville.
1. Walk east (towards downtown) a bit until you get to the trailhead, which is [very hidden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPFqysFNxADQtZLG8).
1. The trail network in the park is huge, and many maps don't do justice to the zig-zagging that you'll do so be careful not to underestimate the distance you have to walk back to the city.
1. When leaving, you can either walk back towards Washington Park for MAX, or leave by [Lower Macleay Park](https://www.portland.gov/parks/trail-lower-macleay), which will also give you the opportunity to go by the [Witch's Castle](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-witches-castle-portland-oregon). Use [TriMet 15 to Gateway TC](https://trimet.org/schedules/r015.htm) at NW 29th & Nicolai if you take this option, noting that only half of 15 trips start west of NW Vaughn & 27th.
