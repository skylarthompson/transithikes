[Redmond Watershed Preserve](https://www.redmond.gov/facilities/facility/details/watershedpreserve-56) is a city park in Redmond, WA, abutting the Redmond Ridge development to the east, and the [Puget Power Trail (aka PSE Trail)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSE_Trail) to the south. It is just outside of the walkshed that trip planning services use but is still reasonably easy and safe to get to using the Power Trail and some on-street walking, due to the Power Trail not actually being contiguous.

1. Catch the [Metro 250](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/routes-and-service/schedules-and-maps/250.html) bus to Avondale from Bellevue TC, South Kirkland P&R, Kirkland TC, or Redmond TC. If you are traveling on a weekday make sure you are on a bus to Avondale and not Bear Creek P&R; Metro provides 15-minute service but at the expense of dropping the Avondale tail from half of the trips.
1. Get off at Avondale & Puget Power Trail and walk east.
   - If you need a bathroom or want to see some farm animals, you can detour to [Farrel-McWhirter Park](https://www.redmond.gov/288/Farrel-McWhirter-Park).
1. Take either the Power Trail or Perimeter Loop trail (if you detour to the park) to 196th Ave NE.
1. Walk N to NE 116th St
1. Walk E in the shoulder to 206th Ave NE.
1. Walk S to NE 112th Street, and then walk W to the continuation of the Power Trail.
1. Keep walking until you run into the Pipeline Connector Trail or Pipeline Regional Trail, both of which will take you through the Watershed Preserve.
1. When returning, simply follow the directions in reverse.

During the week, Metro's [224 DART](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/routes-and-service/schedules-and-maps/224.html) service runs along Novelty Hill Road and makes various stops in Redmond Ridge, but its lack of frequency makes trip planning tricky unless you're willing to wait in a suburban waste for an hour or more.
