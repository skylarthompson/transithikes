[Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park](https://www.ocparks.com/parks-trails/whiting-ranch-wilderness-park) is a county park northeast of Irvine in Orange County. It has a variety of habitats, combining scrubland, forest, desert, and Red Rock Canyon. Transit service is not great (it is in Orange County), but is serviceable. Note that if you use [Metrolink](https://metrolinktrains.com/) and connect to a bus *at a Metrolink station*, your Metrolink ticket serves as a transfer. Returning, though, you will need regular fare with the OC Bus app. You would do well to buy a day pass using the OCBus phone app, as regular fare is one-way and does not include a transfer. Despite the general mediocrity of OC transit, at least at $4.50/day you're not overpaying for it.

A couple important things to note:
- The park has limited water. While there is a water spigot at Four Corners, water pressure is frequently too low to supply it. There is a water fountain at Borrego Park but inside the park assume there will be no water.
- There are rattlesnakes and mountain lions. They will not harm humans generally unless startled, so make your prescence known.

1. Find your way to the [Irvine Metrolink/Amtrak station](https://metrolinktrains.com/rider-info/general-info/stations/irvine/), using the Inland Empire or Orange County Metrolink lines, or [Amtrak Surfliner](https://www.amtrak.com/pacific-surfliner-train).
1. See if your arrival is timed with [Irvine iShuttle 480](https://www.octa.net/ebusbook/RoutePDF/route480.pdf); this will take you to Lake Forest-Regency and you can walk into the park on the [Serrano Creek Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/serrano-creek-trail) at [Etnies Skate Park](https://www.lakeforestca.gov/en/facilities/etnies-skatepark-lake-forest) just south of CA-241.
1. If you're not able to make that timed connection, take [OCBus route 86 heading to east Mission Viejo](https://www.octa.net/ebusbook/RoutePDF/route086.pdf) to Jeronimo-El Toro, transfer to [OCBus route 89 heading north to Santa Margarita](https://www.octa.net/ebusbook/RoutePDF/route089.pdf) across the street, get off at Santa Margarita-Los Alisos, and then transfer to [OCBus route 177 to Laguna Hills](https://www.octa.net/ebusbook/RoutePDF/route177.pdf) and get off at Market-Portola. Across the street will be Borrego Park with the Red Rock Canyon trailhead.

Once inside the park, there is a large trail network at a variety of difficulty levels. Red Rock Canyon is spectacular, and the trails toward Four Corners have great views.

When returning, note that the intersection of Jeronimo-El Toro (where you transfer between the 86 and 89) is only 2.5 miles from the Irvine train station. If you miss your connection to the 86, consider just walking along Jeronimo to Alton, go west on Alton to Barranca, and just walk on Barrnca to the station.
