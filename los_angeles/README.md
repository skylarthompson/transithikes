Despite what you may think, hiking by public transit is possible in the LA area. My assumption is that you will be able to get to a Metrolink or LA Union station.

Transit in the LA area is incredibly fragmented. You would do well to have a TAP card or phone app, Metrolink app, and OCBus app. TAP cards will work on LA Metro, Big Blue Bus, and many other systems, and sometimes even give you transfers between agencies. You will have to do a lot of research to figure out the exact pairs of agencies that have transfer agreements.
